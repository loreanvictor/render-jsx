# render-jsx

_JSX is NOT React, its time to democratize it._

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is an extension of JavaScript syntax, 
allowing for XML-style layout description within JavaScript. To use it, you need to tell your transpiler (babel / typescript)
what the JSX should mean. `render-jsx` provides tools and abstractions to make that process easy and standardized, so that you
can easily build JSX-based tools / libraries / frameworks based on it.

```bash
npm i render-jsx
```
