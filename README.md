# `render-jsx`

Tools for building JSX-based libraries / frameworks, also a super-thin and fast pure DOM renderer.

```bash
npm i render-jsx
```

```tsx
import { HTMLRenderer } from 'render-jsx';

const renderer = new HTMLRenderer();
renderer.render(
  <div>
    <b>Hellow</b> World!

# Overview

[JSX](https://facebook.github.io/jsx/) is an syntax extension of JavaScript, 
allowing for XML-style representations within JavaScript. JSX needs to be transpiled (since it is an extension),
with transpilers such as [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) or [Babel](https://babeljs.io).
Transpilers in turn need to know what JSX should mean.

`render-jsx` provides abstraction for specifying that _meaning_ in a highly extensible way, allowing re-use
of components and common JSX patterns across different domains.
For example, you can re-use your components (or your custom class-based component system) while rendering to DOM (client-side),
to HTML string (server side), to native UI libraries, to custom input format of a PDF generator, etc.

`render-jsx` also comes with a super-thin and fast DOM renderer (which is mostly meant as a basis of more involved UI renderers). 
This means you can use it to create simple web interfaces without any extra dependency (`render-jsx` itself is 2.7kB).
