# render-jsx

_JSX is NOT React, its time to democratize it._

[JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is an extension of JavaScript syntax, 
allowing for XML-style layout description within JavaScript. 
`render-jsx` allows you to easily define what that JSX should mean in the context of your application / library / framework.

```bash
npm i render-jsx
```
